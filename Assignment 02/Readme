Problems Faced:
First of all, required libraries must be installed before executing the code. Our block of code was not running without “yywrap()” for “email address” code. It was asking for a wrap reference. So wrap up library is installed to execute our code without any hurdles.
There were no problems found in our “phone number” program and it was executed properly. However, we added some conditions to improve our code.
